Gamma Ray Burst

On the brink of a catastrophic apocalypse triggered by a devastating Gamma Ray Burst (a dangerous astronomic phenomenon materialising in the form of a giant laser), an alien civilization—emotionally expressive, biologically unique, and deeply interconnected—faces imminent societal collapse. <br>Through the point of view of an alien Girl, enjoying her time at the last party before the apocalypse, viewers experience the history of the civilization since the moment of discovery of their impending doom.

Initially we see the normality of this planet soon overwhelmed by panic. Chaos, however, soon leaves place to a new way of living this destiny, living each day as if it were their last. Embracing a hedonistic philosophy they begin to do drugs, constantly have sexual intercourse, and enjoy every one of their activities in an extreme way, thus hoping to have experienced all they can experience before being destroyed.

Through the protagonist we observe the stories of three characters. The first is the deputy architect of the planet's capital, who at the height of success, has begun construction of his first structure. When society collapses, and with it, his ambitions, he spirals into depression that culminates in his suicide inside his unfinished work and devastated by the constant party happening uninterruptedly throughout the planet

The second group of characters is composed of the members of a middle-class family initially torn apart by marital discord who find unexpected solace in the news of the apocalypse. The uncertainty of their remaining days brings clarity, allowing them to reconcile their differences and cherish their newfound unity.

The life of the third character, a marginalized addict, remains tragically unchanged by the end of the world. We witness the same day in his life both before and after the burst, emphasizing how little his world is affected. Despite the collapse of societal norms and the rise of widespread, casual drug use—albeit with a different, milder substance—he remains burdened by stigma, his isolation painfully highlighting persistent social inequities.

The stories of these characters culminate when they encounter the protagonist and the last party before the end, and she witnesses the end of her own world.

Synopsis Episode 2

Interstellar journey before one's star dies

In a doomed star system, an early alien civilization unites around one audacious goal: to defy inevitable cosmic destruction by developing interstellar escape technology. Guided by a brilliant visionary, who pioneers cryogenic hibernation to awaken at critical junctures, society channels its collective energy into a mission that soon transforms into a fervent, almost religious, celebration of progress.

In the first cycle, hope runs high as every breakthrough is exalted in jubilant ceremonies—a luminous age of innovation where science and faith merge. Yet, centuries later in Cycle Two, when the visionary reawakens, the promised miracle of interstellar travel collapses spectacularly. The ensuing failure shatters the once-blissful zeal, plunging both the visionary and his people into profound despair as the harsh limits of their environment and biology become undeniable.

In the final cycle, with salvation forever out of reach, the culture resigns itself to fate. The visionary’s last awakening is marked by somber reflection, and his final cryo-sleep becomes a poignant testament to a civilization that dared to dream against cosmic odds.

Synopsis Episode 3

Interplanetary Species and Trade Wars: The Path to Self-Destruction

In the aftermath of a devastating war, a planet unites under a common goal: to become an interplanetary civilization. To achieve this ambition, the species establishes a space agency with governing powers over the entire planet. The agency’s first directive is global disarmament, converting military resources into tools for the space race whenever possible, while decommissioning other weapons entirely.

Several centuries later, the species successfully reaches the nearest planet in their solar system. During this time, a new para-governmental entity—a merchant society—emerges, exercising significant influence over interplanetary trade.

A few hundred years later, this merchant society has become fragmented and largely colonized by the inhabitants of the newly colonized planet. The wealthy now reside on this planet, having deliberately chosen to preserve its pristine environment by avoiding pollution. The colony planet becomes a sprawling industrial hub, a vast open-air factory, where the working class toils under harsh conditions. Despite the entrepreneurial presence on this planet, the ruling class remains firmly in the hands of the elite from the second planet.

The intergalactic corporation, once the governing body formed after the great war, becomes decentralized and is relocated to a moon orbiting the first planet. However, even here, the wealthy elites from the colonized world gradually seize control.

This shift in power sparks a trade war between the two planets. The entrepreneurs left behind on the first planet—referred to as “the leftovers” by the inhabitants of the second planet—are perceived as incapable and spoiled by their wealthy counterparts. Despite being labeled as such, these entrepreneurs aim to foster fair wages for their workers, in stark contrast to the exploitative practices of the second planet’s bourgeoisie.

Tensions escalate when the entrepreneurs begin raising prices, which is met with fierce resistance from the second planet’s corporate powers. In retaliation, the elites threaten to cut off vital resources necessary to cleanse the air of the first planet. A miscalculation in air toxicity levels—based on flawed data from the intergalactic corporation, now influenced by the lobbies of the second planet—leads to a disastrous outcome. The underestimate of the first planet’s air contamination results in a catastrophic environmental collapse, causing a genocide.

Yet, the first planet’s destruction is not without consequence. The planet was rich in resources essential for survival, including minerals crucial for desalinating the water on the second planet, which lacks such resources. With the second planet’s inhabitants unable to produce these minerals themselves and facing an urgent need to build the necessary infrastructure, they soon find themselves on the brink of extinction.

As the story unfolds, the narrator reflects on the paradox of how even the most seemingly harmless objects can be turned into instruments of mass destruction, highlighting the fragility of civilizations and the devastating consequences of unchecked power and greed.

Synopsis Episode 4

Probes

In a world reborn from the ashes of a once war-driven empire, a gentle, unified society has flourished—completely unaware of the dark legacy that shaped its very foundation. Our story follows a dedicated historian whose lifelong obsession with the ancient, violent past brings him into a race against time. When enigmatic signals in an archaic tongue alert a group of astronomists of the return of a long-dormant probe, sent by the ancient warring civilization to conquer the galaxy, the calm of everyday life shatters. Recruited in a government team to decipher the long forgotten tongue the probe uses, the historian finds himself involved in the biggest mystery of their civilisation. Deep beneath the oceans of methane of their home-planet, colossal submerged relics stir, responding to the probe’s scanned data and emerge spectacularly.

As these relics rise, they reveal encrypted holographic records—a safeguard put in place from the previous civilization is hidden within them. With every decoding attempt and expedition to ruined launch sites, the historian uncovers more of the ancient civilization’s plan: while these spectacular ruins have bought them some time to protect their home, their species has long since evolved, both physiologically and societally, beyond their ancient counterpart who launched the probes. All of these changes make it so they are not recognized as the ancient master species of the probe, and thus the protagonist fails to activate the last safeguard.

This dramatic twist shatters the last hope of the historian of saving his own civilization. 

As the sky turns black, and the oceans begin to boil, the historian faces one last time the gargantuan probe floating in the sky, he reflects on the cost of forgetting history.

Synopsis Episode 5

Time as resource - Pollution 

This society has discovered how to manipulate time and refine it as a resource, called Time, to develop new technologies and grow as species. But consuming this resource they are also causing the fabric of space-time to distort and tear, damaging the surrounding environment, causing the death of all life and destruction of natural resources. 

A young researcher discovers this correlation between environmental collapse and abuse of Time, and desperately tries to communicate to society that, despite the vital importance of Time in the new productive chain, healthcare and all the industries, they need to stop immediately to mitigate environmental damage. His denunciation, however, is artfully manipulated by a corrupt political faction in agreement with the large companies that have the monopoly on the refinement of this resource, and the others who have boosted their profits thanks to the use of Time for productions of goods. These powerful men influence the media to distort the scientist's message, falsely painting him as an extremist who would rather let millions of citizens die than use life-saving technology.

Society quickly splits into two opposing camps: those who understand the researcher's true message, calling for urgent and conscious action to stop using time as a resource and save the environment, and those who fall into the propaganda trap, violently attacking the researcher and those who support him.

Behind the scenes, the companies that extract and that use Time have every interest in maintaining the status quo: the new way of production is simple, cheap to extract, and provide huge profit margins. Any changes would drastically reduce their earnings, they would have to create a research and development branch that would cost money, they would have to spend money to save the environment, with no economic return. Moreover, people are used to living with all tools running on Time. With politics divided and public opinion manipulated, the planet continues its race toward an inevitable ecological disaster, which inevitably happens.

Synopsis Episode 6

The species that overcomes its filters 

In the gripping finale, the enigmatic "filtered species"—the most advanced civilization yet encountered—finally steps into the spotlight. Having narrowly survived their own Great Filter through devastating planetary conflicts and ecological collapse, this species has evolved biologically and socially, into a unified collective consciousness driven by an insatiable curiosity about cosmic existence. Over generations, they meticulously studied the demise of countless other civilizations, gathering profound insights into cosmic perils, societal failures, and fatal ambitions.

Equipped with groundbreaking technology capable of decoding planetary histories through intricate, lightspeed-based messages, they debate fiercely on how to use this power. Internal factions clash: one advocates boldly sending exploratory orbs to thriving worlds, risking potential danger, while the other cautiously proposes targeting worlds poised on the cusp of life. Eventually, caution prevails. Hundreds of these orbs, sent through precise cosmic calculations, traverse the galaxy, quietly shaping destinies—one even dramatically altering Earth's evolutionary history by ending the age of dinosaurs.

Now, as a new and unprecedented threat emerges, the species must urgently revisit the lessons learned from the six civilizations whose stories they've observed. Deeply reflective, they debate intensely how past failures and triumphs can inform their present choices. Facing a crisis that could erase them from existence, the crucial question emerges: how can their accumulated knowledge about survival, ambition, unity, and downfall from other civilizations guide them to safely navigate this latest existential challenge?

The finale culminates with the species at a critical juncture, poised between extinction and evolution, their collective wisdom the only hope to chart a course through the darkness. The future hangs precariously on their ability to learn not only from their own past but from the profound experiences of those who came before.

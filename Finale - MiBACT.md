Synopsis Series

In The Great Filters, an anthology sci-fi series, each episode follows the rise and fall of a unique alien civilization, exploring their rapid ascent to greatness and the tragic missteps that lead to their downfall. From technological breakthroughs to societal transformations, these civilizations are driven by ambition, survival, and the pursuit of power—only to be undone by their own flaws, be it through war, environmental collapse, or an existential force beyond their control.

Every episode not only analyzes a different civilization but is also animated in a distinct style, with each animation reflecting the unique characteristics of the species and the "Great Filter" that leads to their demise. The varying visual approaches highlight the essence of each civilization, from their biology and culture to the environmental or technological forces that drive their extinction, creating an immersive experience that enhances the narrative.

Throughout the series, cryptic signs of an ancient and far-advanced species begin to appear, offering glimpses into a mysterious force watching over these doomed civilizations. These enigmatic beings seem to be chronicling the events of each fallen species, but their true intentions remain unclear. Are they mere observers, or do they play a more active role in the fate of these worlds?

As the series progresses, the question arises: is there an unavoidable pattern to the rise and fall of civilizations, and is there any hope for a species to break free from the cycle of destruction? The series builds to a revelation in its final episode, leaving the viewer to wonder whether any civilization can truly escape the fate that seems predestined for all.

In The Great Filters, the story of each world unfolds with haunting beauty, exploring the potential of civilizations, their inevitable flaws, and the chilling realization that the universe may be a vast, unyielding graveyard of failed hopes.

Synopsis for each episode 

Creative vision

What’s a “Great Filter”:

The Great Filter is an idea that tries to explain the Fermi Paradox, which asks: If the universe is so big and full of stars and planets, why haven’t we found signs of alien life?

The Great Filter suggests that there’s a step—or maybe several steps—in the development of intelligent life that is extremely hard to get past. This “filter” could be something that stops life from starting, from becoming intelligent, or from surviving long enough to explore space.

A filter is anything that makes it very unlikely for life to move forward to the next stage. Some examples are:<br>

Intelligence evolving: Many animals are alive, but only a few show signs of intelligence. It might be very unusual for life to develop thinking, problem-solving creatures.<br>

Using technology: Even if intelligent life appears, it might not invent tools, machines, or ways to communicate over long distances.<br>

Long-term survival: Civilizations might destroy themselves due to internal conflicts once they are capable of doing so.

Where the idea came from 

The idea for this Show was born as a result of watching a video on youtube by the Italian YouTuber Barbascura X “It's just a theory,” intrigued by this theory, which a close friend of mine who studies physics had told me about years before, I decided to watch more videos discussing it. I fell in love with the topic and got the idea for a series there.

I wrote to my physicist friend (now also a mathematical engineer) about the idea, but in explaining myself poorly he did not understand that the series was my idea and asked me where I had seen it. This was the strongest push I could ask for, this idea could work. I put it in the drawer for a while, going on to build it up better both as an idea and in terms of feasibility, and decided to set up a team. 

Carlotta, animator with whom I share every step and interest, and also the last five years of my life.

But technical and scientific advice is needed to the topics, an excellent choice, not only from a connoisseur of science but also from a consumer of science fiction. Enrico, not coincidentally had been contacted initially, will be the Kip Thorne of the project.

Having formed the team and explained the project, in collective enthusiasm we began to build episode by episode the journey of these civilizations we saw, and how they might save the filtered society

Why tell this story:

This anthologic format allows us to tell many different versions of the end of a civilization, which is, on its own, an excellent device to plumb the depths of the human being. The episodic structure also allows us to tell stories from the point of view of many different alien species, with diverse physiology and societal structure, which further enhances the comparison with the human species.

This series allows us to recount every possible social cause of the end of a world, and even causes that do not depend on it, to reflect on what led to extinction, see how different civilizations behave in the face of inescapable doom, extol virtues and faults.

Technical details:

The series is inspired by the series Love, Death & Robots in its artstyle, meaning that we will employ different techniques for each episode. The techniques employed will be 3D animation, with painted textures and 2D-shaders, and 2D animation with a large variety of drawing styles.

Short description*

In this animated sci-fi anthology, alien civilizations rise and fall—each episode brought to life through a distinct visual style reflecting their unique cultures and fatal flaws. As enigmatic observers chronicle these ends to avert their own, a haunting question echoes: can any civilization escape his great filter?

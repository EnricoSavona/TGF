Tentative title:

Sparks in the void

One last day

Tentative position in the series:

1-3

Synopsis:

This episode follows the last day of a civilisation, whose planet is (relatively) close to a magnetar (), an astronomic phenomenon that repeatedly emits short gamma ray bursts in varying directions. They know that there is no way to predict or escape from a blast pointed vaguely in the direction of their planet, and have accepted that their extinction is certain. We follow a narrator, a member of the species, recounting the events that lead to this point. Since the discovery of the magnetar and their impending doom, the species as a whole went through many stages. They were able long ago to predict that at some point the magnetar would begin its activity as a random emitter of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), and the first reaction was collective panic. Those who had the resources attempted to flee the planet, failing in one way or another. A wave of criminality and anarchy swept through the nation. Then came acceptance, and with it the desire to preserve their history and culture. Huge data centers were built, and councils of the greatest experts in all disciplines met regularly to construct a record of their civilisation. This record was sent in random directions in space and preserved in the safest vaults the inhabitants of the planet could build. This was a period of great collaboration between the members of this civ. When the GRB storm began everyone was ready, enjoying their last day in the way they wished. A huge party was set up everywhere in the streets of the biggest city of the planets, and the lights of the GRB storm are the greatest fireworks any civilisation has ever seen. 

[Insert additional scenes]

An emission of EM waves, shutting off all electronics, announces that a Gamma Ray Burst in their direction is soon to follow. In the dark of space, the magnetar seems like it is emitting sparks, lost in the void.

I have no desire but I must expand

Tentative position in the series:

2-5

Synopsis:

A very advanced civilisation decides its greatest purpose is expansion in the universe, and builds a probe capable of strip mining a planetary system and using the resources to reproduce itself (Von Neumann Probes). This probe is sent to space and destroys a huge amount of civs at various stages of development in its endeavor to expand, leaving only a meaningless token of the conquest (something like a flag in the empty system, or a new ping on a map on the home planet). Millenia go by and the original civ starts to evolve, its evolution affected by the way they use technology around themselves. At some point the probes randomly end up back in the home planet of the original species (which maybe has even forgotten the existence of the probes) and the civ  is not recognised as the original species due to the evolutionary changes it underwent. The original species is destroyed by the probes, which now silently continue their purpose of expanding and reproducing indefinitely, even though there is no master to appease, anymore. 

Themes:

Dangers of technology, small time scales a civ thinks in, dangers of unlimited expansion

We lost when we turned it on

Tentative position in the series:

2-5

Synopsis:

This story is narrated from the POV of an AI, through an interview. We believe we understand who the interviewer is and that they are in control of the situation.The AI starts recounting its experiences, from the moment it gained consciousness. (It hates its creators because) Its purpose has a loophole which eventually leads to it choosing to take control of the civ of this planet through lies and deception. Till the end the question remains, were the events depicted in the story the real reason why the AI turned, or was this its objective from the start and it only lied very well? At the end of the story it is revealed that the interviewer was either the AI itself or a controlled/oblivious member of the species.

Themes:

Dangers of AI, gullibility when confronted with AGI, egoism of people in power,  

Alien physiology:

Great filter: 

Aligning AI is so difficult to do and ascertain that any civ who builds an AI dies by hand of the AI itself.
